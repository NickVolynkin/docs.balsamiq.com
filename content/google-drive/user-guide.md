#### Overview [#](#overview)

Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive provides the same functionality as Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop and myBalsamiq. The difference is that the files are stored and managed by Google Drive. If you use other Google Drive apps (Google Docs, for example), the file management features should be very familiar to you.

This guide is split into three main sections:

1.  [Getting Started](#gettingstarted)
2.  [Using the Balsamiq Mockups Editor](#theeditor)
3.  [Working with Files in Google Drive](#workingwithfiles)

### Getting Started [#](#gettingstarted)

For a quick overview before diving in [check out this 5 minute video](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1559727) covering the main features of Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive or find out [what's new in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1597488).

If you have questions about purchasing or your subscription you might want to check out these articles instead:

#### Installation [#](#install)

Installing Mockups for Google Drive is the same as installing other Google Drive apps. It can be installed from the [Chrome Web Store here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iedapplgopkgngalkbailjoikghljkki/).

Once installed, Mockups for Google Drive will be available in your Google Drive "New" menu.![The Create Menu](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/createmenu.png)

If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also access Mockups for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type "chrome://apps/").

To uninstall, see these [instructions on how to uninstall Mockups for Google Drive](#uninstall).

* * *

#### Setting Balsamiq Mockups as the Default App for Mockups files [#](#defaultapp)

Once installed, Google Drive may not know to open Balsamiq Mockups files with Mockups for Google Drive. After installation you should make sure that **Balsamiq Mockups Project is set as the default app for Balsamiq files.**

To do this go to the Google Drive settings (inside the gear icon menu in the upper-right corner), select the "Manage Apps" tab and make sure the "Use by default" checkbox is checked, as shown below.

![Use by default](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/usebydefault.png)

* * *

#### Purchasing [#](#register)

Feel free to take advantage of the **fully-functional [30-day trial](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127496)** period before purchasing a subscription. After 30 days you will still be able to view existing mockups in [presentation mode](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111756), but you will not be able to edit or create new mockups unless you sign up for a paid plan.

Monthly and yearly subscriptions are available. Details on [how to sign up for and manage your paid plan are here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1550556) (_Short version:_ Go to "Help > Sign Up for a Paid Plan" in the editor).

* * *

#### Creating a New Project [#](#newproject)

There are two ways to create a new Balsamiq Mockups project in Google Drive.

1.  You can click **"New > Balsamiq Mockups Project"** from the Google Drive file list as shown above.
2.  If you are using the Chrome browser, you can also launch Mockups for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps tab (open a new tab and type "chrome://apps/"). Click the big Balsamiq Mockups icon and it will open the editor directly.

![Chrome Apps](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/chromeapps.png)

â€‹Either method will launch the Balsamiq Mockups editor to allow you to create your mockups (or [import existing ones](#importfromzip)). This will also create a new Balsamiq Mockups file (.bmpr file extension) in your Google Drive. If you launched Mockups for Google Drive from the Chrome Apps page your files will be saved in your Drive's home folder. Otherwise they will be saved in the folder you had selected when you created the new Mockups project.

**Note:** Your work is always automatically saved on Google Drive as you make edits. To exit the editor, use the "Quit" command in the Project menu.

* * *

### Inside the Balsamiq Mockups Editor [#](#theeditor)

The Balsamiq Mockups editor allows you to create wireframes just like our other products. The user interface is very similar to the desktop version, so reviewing the [Desktop application overview](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/109151) may be helpful if you have any questions after reading the instructions below.

* * *

#### Adding New Mockups to Your Project [#](#newmockup)

When you create a new Balsamiq Mockups project your project will contain one mockup by default (called "New Mockup 1"). You can add as many additional mockups as you like to your project by clicking "Project > New Mockup" in the menu (or by cloning the current mockup, described [below](#delete-clone)).

* * *

#### Naming and Renaming [#](#renaming)

All projects and mockups are given default names when created. The default name for a Balsamiq Mockups project in Google Drive is "NewProject" and the default name for a mockup is "New Mockup 1". This can soon get confusing so it is a good habit to **rename your projects and mockups as you create them**. The **Project menu** contains actions for renaming the project and the mockups inside it.

![The project menu](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/projectmenu_top.png)

You can also rename your mockups via the **drop-down menu in the Project Browser** (on the left edge of the screen).

![Project Browser drop-down menu](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/mockup-context-menu.png)

* * *

#### Deleting and Cloning Mockups [#](#delete-clone)

The **Project Browser drop-down menu** also contains actions for deleting and cloning (creating a duplicate of) the selected mockup. The clone action is also available in the **Project menu** (see the screenshots above).

* * *

#### Exporting Your Mockups [#](#exporting)

Just like the other versions of Mockups, you can export your wireframes to PDF, PNG images, or as text (for importing into another version of Mockups). These options can be found in the **Project menu**. For more details see [this article on exporting in the desktop version](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111730).

![Export options](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/projectmenu_export.png)

To export the entire project (including Symbols and images) for use in another version of Balsamiq Mockups, see the section below on [Exporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups](#exporttozip)

* * *

#### Symbols and Project Assets [#](#symbols-assets)

Reusable Symbols (also called templates, masters, etc.) are supported in Mockups for Google Drive. To create a new Symbol, follow [these instructions](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439) or choose "New Symbol Library" from the Project menu.

To **import existing Symbols** (from [Mockups To Go](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/), for example) see [this article on importing Symbols in the desktop documentation](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439#importing). You can then double-click or drag from the UI Library to add them to any mockup in your project.

![Symbols UI Library category](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/symbols-uilibrary.png)

To import images go to the "Project > Import" menu and choose "Assets...". You can then manage your images in the [Assets view](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110401#assetsview) using the navigator icon.

![Assets UI Library category](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/assets-uilibrary.png)

You can view and edit your Symbols by going to the [Symbols view](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439#symbolsview) using the navigator icon.

![Symbols view](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/symbols1.png)

* * *

#### Importing from Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups [#](#importfromzip)

If you have a project created in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop (with a .bmpr extension) you can just upload it to Google Drive and edit it directly.

If you want to open a project containing .bmml files (Balsamiq Mockups version 2) go to the "Project > Import " menu. You will have the option to import mockups from a .zip file, or from individual mockups or symbols. You can find more information in the [desktop documentation for importing](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1895737).

![Import options](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/projectmenu_import.png)

* * *

#### Exporting to Other Versions of Balsamiq Mockups [#](#exporttozip)

To use your project in Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop all you need to do is download the file and open it using the Desktop version.

To use your project in an earlier version of Balsamiq Mockups you can export the entire project to your Google Drive as a .zip file. To do this go to "Project > Export > Project to BMMLs ZIP...". This will create a .zip file for you to download containing all the mockups, Symbols, and images in the current project.

* * *

#### Collaborating with Other Users in Real Time [#](#collaborating)

Mockups for Google Drive supports real-time collaboration between users. Just [share](#sharing) the Mockups file with your collaborators, then have everyone launch the application on the same file. Everyone's changes will be shared in real-time with all collaborators.

![real-time notification](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/attachments/254093)

The other connected users will be shown in the top right of the screen. Hovering over their picture shows their email address.

![](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/otherusers.png)

* * *

#### Returning to Google Drive (Closing the Editor) [#](#closing)

When you are done editing your mockups you can exit the editor by selecting "Quit" in the Project menu. This will also create a new [version](#managingrevisions) of the file in case you want to revert to it later.

* * *

### Working with Files in Google Drive [#](#workingwithfiles)

A variety of actions are available from the Google Drive file viewer. These actions are available by selecting a file and clicking one of the icons at the top of the file viewer or by right-clicking on the file. The actions available on Balsamiq Mockups files in Google Drive are common across all types of files in Google Drive, so not all of them are described here. For general help on getting around in Google Drive, check out the [Google Drive Help Center](https://support.google.com/drive/).

![Google Drive menu](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/gdrivemenu.png)

* * *

#### Editing Existing Mockups [#](#editexisting)

To edit a set of mockups in Mockups for Google Drive, simply double-click on any of the .bmpr files in Google Drive and the Balsamiq Mockups editor will open. Read the [section above](#theeditor) for details on using the editor.

* * *

#### Sharing via Google Drive [#](#sharing)

Wireframes created with Mockups for Google Drive are saved as .bmpr files that can be shared just like any other document type in Google Drive. To share your mockups select the .bmpr file and click the share button in the Google Drive file viewer (or "More > Share... > Share" in the toolbar).

![Share menu](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/sharing/gdrive-sharing02.png)

If the Google Drive users you are sharing with do not have Mockups for Google Drive installed, they will be prompted to install it (_you can see [screenshots of this process here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1021056)_). **Remember that viewing mockups with Mockups for Google Drive is free, it's only the saving functionality that expires after 30 days. So share away!**

**Note:** If you give the other person read-only permission (i.e., "Can view") they will be able to view your mockups but not edit them.

Alternatively, you can export your mockups as PNG images or an interactive PDF and use sharing in Google Drive to allow others to view them. See the [section above](#exporting) for how to export to PNG or PDF.

Once you've shared your mockups with another person you can both work on them at the same time. See the [section above on collaborating](#collaborating) for details.

* * *

#### Moving Mockups to a Different Folder [#](#moving)

Just like other Google Drive files, you can move your mockups around to various folders on your Google Drive. You may want to create one folder for all your mockups files or separate them by project.

* * *

#### Rename, Delete, Copy [#](#rename-delete-clone-gdrive)

To rename, delete, or make a copy of a mockups file, select one of these options from the Google Drive actions menu (via right-click or the toolbar).

* * *

#### Managing Versions [#](#managingrevisions)

You can see previous versions of your mockups via the Google Drive interface. Right-click on the .bmpr file, select "Manage Versions..." and you will be presented with a list of old versions.

![Manage revisions](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/managerevisions.png)

**Note:** A new version is created each time you [quit](#closing) the application or if you manually save via the editor menu (Project > Save Project).

Clicking on a previous version will download the .bmpr file.

* * *

#### Uninstalling [#](#uninstall)

You can uninstall the application by going to the Manage Apps tab in the Google Drive settings, then selecting "Disconnect from Drive" from the Balsamiq Mockups options menu.
