If you want to buy from Atlassian Marketplace, you can use the "Buy now" button.

Below are a few screenshots of what you can expect there.

## Selecting Balsamiq Wireframes Editors

If you purchased your plugin license via Atlassian Marketplace, all of your JIRA users will be able to access the plugin.

If instead you purchased your plugin license from Balsamiq, depending on your Balsamiq Wireframes and JIRA license levels, you might see different instructions on the plugin licensing page regarding who can create and edit new wireframes.

In short: if your plugin license is lower than your JIRA license, you’ll have to create a JIRA user group (by default called _balsamiq-wireframes-editors_) and add people to it manually, making sure that you don’t add more than what your plugin allows for.

You can customize the name of the Balsamiq Wireframes editors group in the add-on configuration page.

If instead you bought an unlimited version of the plugin, everyone will be able to create and edit wireframes. If you’d like to limit this ability to a group of users, create a group of licensed wireframes editors and add people to it. If the group exists, the plugin will honor it. If not, it will act as if you had a group with everyone in it.

## Updating Instructions

Installing via UPM automatically replaces the old plugin with the new version.

If you are running an old version of JIRA and want to figure out which version of the plugin to update to, head to the [Support End of Life Policy](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/atlassianeol/) page.

* * *

## Uninstalling Instructions

Uninstalling via UPM automatically removes all plugin modules from your JIRA.

The wireframes project created with the plugin will **NOT** be deleted. They will just stay where they are as attachments to issues, but you will not be able to view or edit it.
