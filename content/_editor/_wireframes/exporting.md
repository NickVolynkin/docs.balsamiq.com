## Exporting to PDF

You can export the wireframes in your project as a PDF, which can be useful for printing, sending by email, presenting to clients, or posting online. If your wireframes contain **links**, these will work in your exported PDF as well, which will allow you to create click-through prototypes of your designs. _(To learn more about linking, see [Linking wireframes Together](../linking/).)_

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Links may not work in the default Windows 8 or 10 PDF viewer. If this happens, you can download [Adobe Acrobat](//acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/products/pdf-reader.html) or one of the many other free PDF viewers.{{% /alert %}}

To export to PDF select the Project > Export to PDF... menu command (shortcut: CTRL/CMD+P). Each wireframe will be displayed on a separate page of a PDF document. The wireframes will be in the same order as in the project, so arrange them in the order you'd like before exporting.

You can choose to export all wireframes or a subset, including any [alternates](../alternates/) you have created.

The PDF export options are shown here.

After exporting, a notification window will appear to show you where your PDF was saved. Click the notification to open the containing folder.

## Exporting to an Image

To save one or all of your wireframes as image files choose one of the export to PNG commands from the Export menu. Export > Current wireframe to PNG... will save the selected wireframe in PNG image format, while Export > All wireframes to PNG... will save all of the wireframes in your project as separate image files. If you check the **"Use Transparent Background"** option the exported images will be transparent anywhere the canvas shows through in the wireframe.

The shortcuts for exporting a wireframe and project to image files are CTRL/CMD+R and CTRL/CMD+Shift+R, respectively. Exporting all wireframes will also generate images for any [alternates](../alternates/) you have created.

You can also export a subset of the controls in your wireframe by selecting them on the canvas and using the Export Current wireframe to PNG command. The export dialog will ask you if you want to export only the selected controls or the entire wireframe.

## Printing

Balsamiq wireframes no longer supports printing directly to a printer. Instead you can [export to PDF](#exporting-to-pdf) and print from a PDF viewer.

## Exporting Wireframes to Another Project

You can copy wireframes or Symbols across projects by dragging them from one project to another. Note that dragging wireframes will only copy them, not remove them from the originating project.

Another method is to use the Import/Export wireframe JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to wireframes JSON (Project > Export > wireframe to JSON) will copy the Balsamiq wireframes code for the selected wireframe to the clipboard. To create this wireframe in a new project switch to it and choose “Import wireframe JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code.
