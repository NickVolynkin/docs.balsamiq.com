## Importing Wireframes From Another Project

You can copy wireframes from one project to another using the Import/Export Wireframe JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Wireframes JSON (Project > Export > Wireframe to JSON > Copy and Close) will copy the Balsamiq Wireframes code for the selected wireframe to the clipboard.

To create this wireframe in a new project, switch to it, choose “Import Wireframe JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code. Images and Symbols won't be copied, however.

You can also select and copy controls on the canvas in one project and paste them into the canvas in another project.{{% /alert %}}

## Importing From Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop

Because Mockups 3 for Desktop uses the same file format (BMPR) than Balsamiq Wireframes and Balsamiq Cloud, importing files there is a pretty straight forward process. You can simply open an existing file in Wireframes for Desktop, or upload it directly in Balsamiq Cloud if you are using our web version.
