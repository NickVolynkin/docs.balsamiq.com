## Importing Wireframes From Another Project

The easiest way to move or copy wireframes from one project to another is to simply drag a wireframe (using the [navigator panel](../overview/#the-navigator-panel)) from one project to another project. You can also select and copy controls on the canvas in one project and paste them into the canvas in another project.

Alternatively you can copy wireframes from one project to another using the Import/Export Wireframe JSON commands in the Project menu. Exporting to Wireframes JSON (Project > Export > Wireframe to JSON) will copy the Balsamiq Wireframes code for the selected wireframe to the clipboard. To create this wireframe in a new project switch to it and choose “Import Wireframe JSON…” from the Project > Import menu and paste the copied code. Images and Symbols won't be copied, however.
