## Changing and Adding Site Owners

In Balsamiq Cloud, you can specify up to two [Site Owners](need a link) per site. By default, the site's creator will be Site Owner, but that can be changed by selecting another [Staff Member](need a link) from the dropdown.

You can specify a 2nd Site Owner via the 2nd dropdown. A 2nd Site Owner can be great for sharing the administrative load!

## Deleting Your Balsamiq Cloud Site

Deleting a site can only be done by the [Site Owner](need a link). To do this, type the name of the site into the box and then click the **Delete Site** button. If you have an active subscription for the site, deleting the site will cancel it.
