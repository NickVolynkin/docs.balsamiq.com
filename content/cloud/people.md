In order to manage users on a Balsamiq Cloud site, you need to be a Staff Member or the Site Owner on that site.

Site Owners can manage users on the global level by clicking on the **People** link in the upper left corner of their projects homepage.

From the manage users page, Site Owners can invite users to their Balsamiq Cloud site.

When inviting from the manage users page, Site Owners can also choose to grant newly invited users with Staff Member permissions. Staff Members can create projects and invite users to any project that they have been given access to. For a full breakdown of Balsamiq Cloud permission differences, check out the [Access Control Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W9LNek14gOSDQ0FCtsULxbqz5xpuUg2azlYty_biKh8/edit#gid=1)

Site owners can also grant and revote Staff Member permissions to existing users by using the **Staff Check Box** next to their account information.

## User Permissions at a Glance

When looking at any Project Card, you will see that some users have different colored borders around their profile pictures. These colors make it so that you can understand their access level at a glance.

## Managing User Permissions on Projects

Managing users on a specific project is something a Site Owner or Staff Member (as long as they are a part of the project) can do by clicking the **Manage Project Members** button on the Project Card.

### Inviting Someone to a Project

To invite a user to a project, type their name (if they are an existing user) or their email (if they are new user) into the **Invite People** box. You can invite multiple users this way, just separate their name/emails with commas.
