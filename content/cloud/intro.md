# Outline
## What is Balsamiq Cloud?

Balsamiq Cloud is a web-based user interface design tool for creating [wireframes](https://support.balsamiq.com/resources/whatarewireframes/) (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your product, app, or website idea to facilitate discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.

Here's a demonstration of how it works.

### Getting Started

To get started, you first need to sign up and create a site. For more information on how to do that, read LINK.

Next, create a project. TEXT HERE.

Depending on how you work, you can also invite collaborators to edit or review the wireframes as you build them. Balsamiq Cloud supports real-time collaboration, comments, and chat, so that multiple people can work on the same project together.

Once you've created a project, the fun begins. Drag and drop, edit, and arrange over 75 user interface control types to create anything you can imagine.

Read about adding and arranging and editing controls to learn how to create your wireframes. If you've never used a Balsamiq product before, you might also want to follow our tutorial on [how to create your first wireframe](link).
