## Managing Balsamiq Cloud Users

In order to manage users on a Balsamiq Cloud site, you need to be a Staff Member or the Site Owner on that site.

Site Owners can manage users on the global level by clicking on the **People** link in the upper left corner of their projects homepage.

When inviting from the manage users page, Site Owners can also choose to grant newly invited users with Staff Member permissions. Staff Members can create projects and invite users to any project that they have been given access to.

Site owners can also grant and revote Staff Member permissions to existing users by using the **Staff Check Box** next to their account information.
