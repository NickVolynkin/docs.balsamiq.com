#### Adding UI Controls[#](#addinguicontrols)

![](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/uilibrary.png)

To add UI controls to your mockup, double-click or drag a control in [the UI Library](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/109151#uilibrary) or type a keyword into [the Quick Add tool](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/109151#quickadd).

You can also duplicate controls already on the canvas using copy and paste or the duplicate command (CTRL/CMD + D). ALT/Option + drag will also duplicate controls and allow you to place them using your mouse.

**Note:** Full list of [keyboard shortcuts here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110445).

#### Selecting UI Controls[#](#selectinguicontrols)

There are a few different ways to select UI controls. If you are familiar with graphics software, these should be of no surprise.

*   Clicking on a UI control selects it
*   Dragging a rectangle which encloses many UI controls selects them
*   SHIFT + CLICK on a control adds it to the selection
*   CTRL/CMD + CLICK on a selected control removes it from the selection
*   Hold ALT to ignore items behind the mouse and drag-select, as shown in [this short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOpaRBbwqNg)

To select a control that is behind another control, right-click on the top control to bring up a menu that allows you to select controls behind it.

#### Moving UI Controls[#](#movinguicontrols)

Once you have selected one or more UI controls, there are a few different ways to move it on the canvas.

*   You can drag it with your mouse (hold down the SHIFT key to maintain the original horizontal or vertical position)
*   You can "nudge it" one pixel at a time with your keyboard's UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys
*   You can move it with bigger steps (10 pixels) by holding down SHIFT and using your keyboard's UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT keys
*   You can move controls to be aligned in one direction by using the [align tools shown below](#aligninguicontrols)

* * *

#### Snapping and Smart Guides [#](#snapping)

When you move objects on the canvas, Mockups tries to suggest alignment relative to other objects on the canvas using smart guides. This makes alignment a little easier and makes your Mockups generally look neater.

If you ever want to temporarily disable this feature, you can hold down the CTRL/CMD key while moving or resizing, and snapping will be turned off.

* * *

#### Resizing UI Controls[#](#resizinguicontrols)

Resizing the selected controls is easy. You can just grab any edge or corner of the selection rectangle and drag it.

If you want to constrain proportions while dragging from a corner, hold the SHIFT key while dragging.

You can also use the keyboard to resize selected controls. CTRL/CMD+ALT+arrow keys to resize in 1px increments, CTRL/CMD+ALT+SHIFT+arrow keys for 10px increments.

Another way to resize some controls to their "natural size" is to use the Auto-Size function found in the [Property Inspector](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110114).

#### Aligning UI Controls[#](#aligninguicontrols)

You can align and distribute (space out) controls by selecting multiple controls and right-clicking to bring up the menu shown below.

The same options are shown in the property inspector when multiple controls are selected.

#### Layering UI Controls[#](#layeringuicontrols)

You can layer controls as if they were pieces of paper on the mockup canvas. To do so, you select the controls you want to layer and select one of four layering commands available via the right-click menu or [Property Inspector](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110114): Bring to Front, Bring Forward, Send Backward, and Send to Back. [Keyboard shortcuts](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110445) are also available.

#### Deleting UI Controls[#](#deletinguicontrols)

To remove some UI controls from the mockup canvas, select them and hit the DELETE key. Alternatively you can click on the trashcan icon in the toolbar or select "Delete" from the Edit menu.

* * *

#### Grouping UI Controls[#](#groupiguicontrols)

Sometimes you might want to group some controls to better align them or to move them all at once. To group a set of controls, select them and hit CTRL+G on your keyboard or use the Group command in the toolbar Edit menu. Once grouped, the controls will behave as one when moving or aligning. To ungroup controls, press CTRL+SHIFT+G on your keyboard or use the Ungroup command in the menu or toolbar. Groups can be nested.

You can double-click on a group to "enter it" and edit its contents. Here's a video that explains how to use the feature:

<div class="video"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OgX27oUrkLY"></iframe></div>

You can optionally give a group a name via the property inspector. This can be helpful when you have a lot of groups and need to "know where you are" when you edit their contents. Naming groups is also useful when creating [Symbols](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439).

#### Cropping Groups[#](#cropping)

It is possible to crop (mask) groups to only show a selected portion of them.

The video below illustrates how to use this powerful feature:
