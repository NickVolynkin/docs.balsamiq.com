The history functions allow you to view recent activity on the site, on a project, or on a mockup. You’ll notice below the project or mockup name that there’s a single line of text showing you the last update and who made it. The “View History…” text at the end of this line is a link to view the entire history of updates.

The type of events that will be recorded in the history are shown below.
