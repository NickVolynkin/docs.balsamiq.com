When you [export your mockups](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111730) (to PDF or PNG, for example) the notes that you've written in the [notes panel](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1844131#notes) do not get exported.

If you want your collaborators or clients to see them you could [share the project file](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/98989#sharebmpr) instead.

If you are using **myBalsamiq** you can [invite people to join your project](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/235574#projectmembers) so that they can see the notes and comments you've made and add their own.
