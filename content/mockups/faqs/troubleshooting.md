Something not working as expected? We're here to help! Here's a short list of steps we recommend.

#### 1\. Check your Version [#](#update)

If you've hit a bug there's a decent chance we've fixed it in a recent update. Start by checking the [**download page**](https://balsamiq.com/download/) to make sure you're running the latest version.

#### 2\. Check the Docs [#](#docs)

If your problem isn't a bug or the application crashing you may find the answer to your question in our documentation. You might want to start with our [**desktop application FAQs**](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127377#faq) or maybe [these FAQs about **installation, licensing and purchasing**](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127377#links). Or you can [**search**](http://support.balsamiq.com/#support-ask) all our docs.
