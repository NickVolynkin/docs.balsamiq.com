Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud was released April 4, 2016. The new version has projects, symbols, real time collaboration and lots of other improvements.

{{< yt zMOxwSdMcWM >}}

We will soon be moving all Confluence Cloud instances to this new connect add-on, however, in the meantime, you may be using an older version of the plugin.

If you haven’t yet purchased Mockups for Confluence, but have a Cloud instance older than April 4, 2016, you will have the older plugin pre-installed. You may have even trialed this version. As this older version will shortly be removed from your Cloud instance, we suggest you disable it via the UPM, install the [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview) version, and trial this add-on. Here are details on [how to install the add-on](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/installation).

If you already purchased Mockups for Confluence for your Cloud instance, continue to use and enjoy Mockups for Confluence! Your users should reference the [Mockups for Confluence Cloud User Guide](../intro/) and the administration of your plugin should refer to [Mockups for Confluence Cloud Admin Guide](../admin-guide-cloud/).

We will soon be migrating your license to the new Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud version. We will be in contact by email with details regarding your options for in this licensing transition and the new pricing and license management in Atlassian Marketplace.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to [contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/s/m4c).

## A New File Format

In the old version of Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence, we stored each mockup in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images. Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud introduces a new project file format called BMPR: everything that belongs to a project (mockups, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Confluence page. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin here.

In order to take advantage of the new features you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.

## Installing Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud

You can install the new plugin simply via the UPM, just search for “Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud” and click “Install” to start the 30-day trial.

{{% alert warning %}}**IMPORTANT**: if you have the old Mockups for Confluence plugin enabled, you MUST disable it at this point, the two plugins cannot work side-by-side.{{% /alert %}}
